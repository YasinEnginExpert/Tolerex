This is a sample document used for validating the FILE and BULK FILE operations in the Tolerex distributed storage system. 
The system is designed to handle varied payloads efficiently. 
Large files are processed as single SET operations, while small files can be batched together.
mTLS ensures that all data in transit between the Leader and Members is fully encrypted.
The P2C load balancer ensures that even under high load, no single member becomes a bottleneck.
Verification of data integrity is performed at each step of the replication pipeline.
This particular file provides a medium-sized payload for RTT measurement and throughput stress testing.
